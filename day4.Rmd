## Day 4

```{python ch1}
from collections import Counter
import random

a = [0,1,1,1,2,3,7,7,23]

def count_eles(seq) -> dict:
    hist = {}
    for i in seq:
        hist[i] = hist.get(i, 0) + 1
    return hist

counted = count_eles(a)
recounted = Counter(a)

print(counted)
print(recounted)

def ascii_hist(seq) -> None:
    counted = count_eles(seq)
    for k in sorted(counted):
        print(f'{k} {"+" * counted[k]}')

random.seed(1)
vals = [1,3,4,6,8,9,10]
freq = [random.randint(5, 15) for _ in vals]

data = []

for f, v in zip(freq, vals):
    data.extend([v] * f)
    
ascii_hist(data)

```
