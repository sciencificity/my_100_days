Tried installing opencv (Open Source Computer Vision Library) and struggled on anaconda

Fix used by jborelli who is a classmate in the 'Intro to DL with Pytorch' course:
-> Activate the main environment on anaconda console:
activate base
-> install with pip (at the base environment it will download the correct version)
pip install opencv-contrib-python
