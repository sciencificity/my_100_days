## Python Exceptions
Exceptions are not syntax errors, but rather code with correct syntax, that raises an error.

### Syntax error
```{python, eval = FALSE}
# This has a syntax error - notice the extra bracket at the end?
print(0/0))
```

### Exception
```{python, eval = FALSE}
# This raises an exception - division by 0
print(0/0)
```

<img src = 'exception1.png'> <br> <br>

### Raising an Exception <br>

#### No exception
x is 5 so no exception is raised.
```{python}
x = 5
if x > 5:
    raise Exception
print('Made it to the end')    
```
<br> <br>
#### Exception
A plain vanilla `Exception` was raised since x is now above 5.
```{python, eval = FALSE}
x = 10
if x > 5:
    raise Exception
print('Made it to the end')    
```

<br> <br>

#### Exception - with descriptive message
```{python, eval = FALSE}
x = 10
if x > 5:
    raise Exception(f'x needs to be 5 or under, here it is {x}')
print('Made it to the end')    
```

### Using Assertions

Assertions follow this general pattern:

> assert (condition), "Optional message if condition not met"

assert checks if the condition in the brackets is met, if it is not an AssertionError is raised and the program is stopped.

<br> <br>

#### No assertion error
Name is quaid so no assertion error raised.
```{python}
name = 'quaid'
assert(name == 'quaid')
print(f'My name is {name} and no assertion error occurred!')
```
<br> <br>

#### AssertionError

Okay now we changed the name to be something else, so an Assertion error will be raised.
```{python, eval = FALSE}
name = 'horton'
assert(name == 'quaid')
print(f'My name is {name} and this line is never run as an assertion error occurred!')
```

<br> <br>

#### AssertionError with Descriptive Message
Just like with exceptions we can add some text message that is displayed along with the AssertionError message.
```{python, eval = FALSE}
name = 'horton'
assert(name == 'quaid'), f'Expected name is "quaid" we got "{name}" instead'
```

### `Try` and `Except`

This follows the blueprint of:

> try: <br>
         code to try running <br>
> except: <br>
        execute this part if an exception is raised <br>

<br> <br>     

#### No Exception
Normal running snippet.
```{python}
# , eval = FALSE}
x = 1
answer = 1/x
print(f'The answer is {answer}')
```
<br> <br>

#### Exception 
##### Division by Zero
Now `x = 0` so we get an exception raised but we cater for such an occurrence explicitly.

```{python}
x = 0
try:
    answer = 1/x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    answer = 'undefined'
print(f'The answer is {answer}')
```
<br> <br>

##### String value division     
```{python, eval = FALSE}
x = 'undefined'
try:
    answer = 1/x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    answer = 'undefined'
print(f'The answer is {answer}')
```        

<img src = 'exception7.png'>
<br> <br>
Now we handle the error specifically.
```{python}
x = 'undefined'
try:
    answer = 1/x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    answer = 'undefined'
except TypeError:
    answer = 'meaningless'
print(f'The answer is {answer}')
```   
<br> <br>

#### `Else` Clause
The else clause only runs if no exceptions occurred. <br>


> try: <br>
         code to try running <br>
> except: <br>
        execute this part if an exception is raised <br>
> else: 
        execute this code if no exceptions

<br> <br>  

```{python}
x = 2
try:
    answer = 1/x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    answer = 'undefined'
except TypeError:
    answer = 'meaningless'
else:
    print('Thanks for putting in a number')
print(f'The answer is {answer}')
```
<br> <br>

#### Finally Clause

`finally` clauses get run whether there were exceptions or not, making them useful for tidying up when programs fail unexpectedly. <br>

> try: <br>
         code to try running <br>
> except: <br>
        execute this part if an exception is raised <br>
> else: <br>
        execute this code if no exceptions <br>
> finally: <br>
        this code is always run <br>

We're going to simulate opening a file .... <br>

The only exception being handled is a divide by 0. The x here is a string so a TypeError will be raised. We opened the file, and then had an exception raised so the file was never closed which is bad practise.
<br> <br>

```{python, eval = FALSE}
x = '2'
print('Simulate opening a file')
try:
    answer = 1/x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    answer = 'undefined'
else:
    print('Thanks for putting in a number')
print(f'The answer is {answer}')
print('Simulate closing a file')
```
<img src = 'exception8.png'>
<br> <br>

That's where `finally` comes in. Here the file will be closed.
```{python, eval = FALSE}
x = '2'
print('Simulate opening a file')
try:
    answer = 1/x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    answer = 'undefined'
else:
    print('Thanks for putting in a number')
finally: 
    print('Simulate closing a file')
print(f'The answer is {answer}')
```
