## Generators
A generator is a function that returns an iterator. It generates values using the `yield` keyword, when called with `next()`. It raises a `StopIteration` exception when there are no more values to generate (analogy Bob uses is that it is like a function that pauses itself -> you call it, you get one value, it pauses, you call it again it gives you another value thus keeping your memory footprint small )

Why would we use this? Sometimes a big list generates performance issues and doesn't fit into memory even. Here a generator is useful as it yields values one by one. 

### Simple generator
```{python}
def num_gen():
    for i in range(5):
        yield i # simplest

gen = num_gen() # store generator in a variable

# get value by calling next()
next(gen)

for i in gen:
    print(i)

```

Notice that the `for loop` only printed from 1 onwards. What happened to 0? This is because the initial `next()` took a value off the generator (it yielded a value), therefore after that call to `next()` the generator only has 4 more values to yield which it does in the subsequent `for` loop call.

Generators consume their sequence once, and once you get to the end and try to go beyond that limit you get a `StopIteration` error. This will happen for us, if we try and call `next()` again as it has exhausted it's values. The `for` loop is clever enough to handle this for us, hence we don't go beyond the end of the generator in the for loop call.

### Pattern: Using generators to build up a sequence

#### Older method would be 
```{python}
options = 'red yellow blue white black green purple'.split()
options

def create_select_options(options = options):
    select_list = []
    
    for option in options:
        select_list.append(f'<option value={option}>{option.title()}</option>')
    
    return select_list
    
from pprint import pprint as pp
pp(create_select_options())
```

#### Now more concise way with a generator
A generator is lazy so the shorter code below is also faster if your data set grows.

```{python}
def create_select_options_gen(options = options):
    for option in options:
        yield f'<option value={option}>{option.title()}</option>'

create_select_options_gen() # gives us a generator

# way to materialise a generator is to convert it to a list
list(create_select_options_gen())
```

### Time difference between lists and generators
Let's calculate which years in a list of 1 million years are leap years using a list and a generator to compare.
```{python}
# import module  
import calendar  
# list version
def leap_year_list(n = 1000000):
    leap_years = []
    for year in range(1, n+1):
        if calendar.isleap(year): # built in way to test if leap year
            leap_years.append(year)
    return leap_years

# generator    
def leap_year_gen(n = 1000000):
    for year in range(1, n+1):
        if calendar.isleap(year):
            yield year
import timeit
# timeit.timeit("leap_year_list()", number = 100, globals=globals())
print(f'The list way is {timeit.timeit("leap_year_list()", number = 400, globals=globals())} long.')
print(f'The generator way is {timeit.timeit("leap_year_gen()", number = 400, globals=globals())} long.')
```

The `timeit` module can be used outside of the command line or the jupyter magic as below <br>

>&emsp;&emsp; %timeit -n1 function_name()

In order to so you need to specify the function you want to test as a string value, and tell timeit to look for your function in the global namespace.

>&emsp;&emsp; import timeit <br> <br>
>&emsp;&emsp; # Remember to have function in quotes; and add globals = globals() to <br>
>&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ensure the timeit function can find the function you want to time <br>
>&emsp;&emsp; # timeit.timeit('remember_to_place_func_name_in_quotes()', <br>
>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;n = how_many_runs, globals=globals()) <br><br>
>&emsp;&emsp; timeit.timeit("leap_year_list()", number = 1, globals=globals()) <br>

```{python pymorsels}
numbers = range(10)
doubled_odds = map(lambda n: n * 2, filter(lambda n: n % 2 == 1, numbers))
print(list(doubled_odds)) # easiest way to print a map / generator is to turn it into a list
doubled_odds_lst = [n * 2 for n in numbers if n % 2 == 1]
print(doubled_odds_lst)

def get_factors(dividend):
    """Return a list of all factors of the given number."""
    return [
        n
        for n in range(1, dividend+1)
        if dividend % n == 0
    ]

print(get_factors(6))

m = [list(range(5)) for i in range(5)]

print(m)
```

### Nested Loops - from PyMorsels post!
What about list comprehensions with nested looping?

Here's a for loop that flattens a matrix (a list of lists):
When working with nested loops in list comprehensions remember that the for clauses remain in the same order as in our original for loops.

> flattened = [] <br>
> for row in matrix:<br>
> &emsp;&emsp;for n in row:<br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;flattened.append(n)<br>

Here's a list comprehension that does the same thing: <br>

> flattened = [n for row in matrix for n in row]

Nested loops in list comprehensions do not read like English prose. Note: My brain(this is Trey talking, but I totally did this when I wanted to write it out myself before seeing the answer :| ) wants to write this list comprehension as:

> flattened = [n for n in row for row in matrix]

But that's not right! I've mistakenly flipped the for loops here. The correct version is the one above.
