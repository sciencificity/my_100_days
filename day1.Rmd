## Day 1

```{python ch1}
# import the relevant functions
from datetime import datetime
from datetime import date
from datetime import timedelta
# Get today's date together with the time component as we're using today()
today = datetime.today()
type(today)
print(today)
```

```{r}

```

```{python}
# Okay, what if we want only the date part of today? Use today()
todaydate = date.today()
type(todaydate)

```{r}
# Okay, what if we want only the date part of today? What d'ya know in lubridate it is the same! today()

```

```{python}
# Can drill into a date even more
print(todaydate.month)

# Define a new date - christmas
christmas = date(2019, 12, 25)
print(christmas)
# So how many days until Christmas?

# Define my 100 day start

# So I will finish by ....

# Can drill into a date even more but in R month, day, year are functions not attributes
