## List comprehensions and generators

```{python}
from collections import Counter
import calendar
import itertools
import random
import re
import string

import requests
```

### List comprehensions
Let's say we want to loop through a bunch of names title-casing each one.

```{python}
names = 'pybites mike bob Julian tim sara Guido kai Elaine'.split()
print(names)
for name in names:
    print(name.title())
```

Now I want to keep only A-M. The `strings` module helps here. It has helpers like ascii_lowercase

```{python}
# use ascii_lowercase to get the lower case letters, subset what you need
# first_half_alpha = list(string.ascii_lowercase)[:13]
# print(first_half_alpha)

# Let's say I mess with the list of names a bit and include already title case ones
# and some lower case ones
# Here we would need the letters a-m and A-M so use the ascii_letters and slice appropriately
first_half_alpha_both = list(string.ascii_letters)[:13] + list(string.ascii_letters[26:39])

print(first_half_alpha_both)

print(list(string.ascii_letters))

```
```{python}
new_names = []

for name in names:
    if name[0] in first_half_alpha_both:
        new_names.append(name.title())
print(new_names)
```

The `for loop` feels verbose though. So let's try out list comprehensions.

```{python}
# we can see this step by step - if we just wanted each ele in the list
print([name for name in names])

# now let's title all as we did initially
print([name.title() for name in names])

# We can also add conditionals in the list comprehensions
print([name for name in names if name[0] in first_half_alpha_both])

# title case the new list
print([name.title() for name in names if name[0] in first_half_alpha_both])

# Making list comprehensions more readable
new_list2 = [
                name.title()
                for name in names
                if name[0] in first_half_alpha_both
            ]
assert(new_list2 == new_names)

```

### Practise bite:

```{python}

def filter_positive_even_numbers(numbers):
    """Receives a list of numbers, and returns a filtered list of only the
       numbers that are both positive and even (divisible by 2), try to use a
       list comprehension."""
    evens = [num for num in numbers if ((num % 2 == 0) and (num > 0))]
    return evens
    
def test_filter_positive_and_negatives():
    numbers = list(range(-10, 11))
    assert filter_positive_even_numbers(numbers) == [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


def test_only_positives():
    numbers = [2, 4, 51, 44, 47, 10]
    assert filter_positive_even_numbers(numbers) == [2, 4, 44, 10]


def test_filter_zero_and_negatives():
    numbers = [0, -1, -3, -5]
    assert filter_positive_even_numbers(numbers) == []

filter_positive_even_numbers(list(range(-10, 11)))    

test_filter_positive_and_negatives()
test_only_positives()
test_filter_zero_and_negatives()

```


Let's load some text from Harry Potter and remove stop words

```{python}
resp = requests.get('http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/pcc/harry.txt')
# Parse the response which is resp.text
# lower case all of the string
# split on the space ' '
words = resp.text.lower().split()
# Let's have a look at a few of the words
words[:5]
```

Let's get the most common words.
```{python}
cnt = Counter(words)
# We use the most_common() func
cnt.most_common(5)
```

Hhmm we should not count stop words like `the`, `a`, `on` etc., and there are also more chars like `-`. Let us first remove the non-alpha characters.

```{python}
print(f'Is there a "-" in the words we got from the text? {"-" in words}')

# remove the non-alpha characters like - etc.
# regex \W matches any non-alpha char - equivalent to writing [^a-zA-Z0-9_]
# If the first character of the set is '^', all the characters that are not in the set will be matched.
# Above says any character not in a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ must be matched
# We use a list comprehension to do so
words = [re.sub(r'\W+',r'', word) for word in words] # may result in empty words, we will take care of that soon

# So is the dash gone?
print(f'Is the "-" in the words gone now? {"-" in words}')
```

Let's remove the stop words now.
```{python}
print(f'Is there a "the" in the words we got from the text? {"the" in words}')
resp = requests.get('http://projects.bobbelderbos.com/pcc/stopwords.txt')
stopwords = resp.text.lower().split()
print(f'The number of stopwords we are considering is: {len(stopwords)}')
# Let's get rid of these from our words list
# words =[word for word in words if word not in stopwords] # my try - but there may be empty strings which we want to strip
# Bob's way includes checking for non-empty words, and words not a stopword
words =[word for word in words if word.strip() and word not in stopwords]
# Is the in words still?
print(f'Is there a "the" in the words list now? {"the" in words}')
```

Let's check the counts again - what's the most common words now?

```{python}
cnt = Counter(words)
cnt.most_common(5)
```
