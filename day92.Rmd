## Reading and Writing csv files in Python

### Reading files
```{python}
import csv

with open('employee_bd.csv') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter = ",")
    line_count = 0
    for row in csv_reader:
        if line_count == 0:
            print(f'Column names are {", ".join(row)}')
        else:
            print(f'''\t{row[0]} works in the {row[1]} dept, and
            was born in {row[2]}''')
        line_count += 1
    print('Processed line count was, ', line_count)


# Use DictReader to refer to columns by name
# The DictReader looks at the first row and assumes those
# are column names and that you can refer to items using those names
# DictReader is a bit friendlier
with open('employee_bd.csv') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file, delimiter = ",")
    line_count = 0
    for row in csv_reader:
        if line_count == 0:
            print(f'Column names are {", ".join(row)}')
        print(f'''\t{row['name']} works in the {row['dept']} dept, and
            was born in {row['birthday month']}''')
        line_count += 1
    print('Processed line count was, ', line_count)

# Read file with a pipe delim
with open("diff_delim.csv") as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file, delimiter = "|")
    line_count = 0
    for row in csv_reader:
        if line_count == 0:
            print(f'Column names are: {", ".join(row)}')
        print(f'''\t{row['name']} works in {row['dept']}, lives at
        {row['address']} and was born in {row['birthday month']}''')
        line_count += 1
    print('Processed line count was {line_count}')

# A file with the address which contains , enclosed
# in "": "address, .., "
with open("diff_delim2.csv") as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file, quotechar = '"')
    line_count = 0
    for row in csv_reader:
        if line_count == 0:
            print(f'Column names are: {", ".join(row)}')
        print(f'''\t{row['name']} works in {row['dept']},
        and lives at {row['address']}''')
        line_count += 1
    print(f'Processed {line_count} lines')

# Another file - this time with an escape character
with open("esc_char.csv") as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file, escapechar = "|")
    line_count = 0
    for row in csv_reader:
        if line_count == 0:
            print(f'Column names are: {", ".join(row)}')
        print(f'''\t{row['name']} works in {row['dept']},
        and lives at {row['address']}''')
        line_count += 1
    print(f'Processed {line_count} lines')

```

### Writing files

```{python}
# Write a file with entries
with open("employee_file.csv", mode='w') as employee_file:
    employee_writer = csv.writer(employee_file,
                        delimiter = ",", quotechar='"', 
                        # this says only wrap in the quotechar, if
                        # the field contains the delimiter or the
                        # quotechar itself
                        quoting = csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
    employee_writer.writerow(['John Smith', 'Accounting"', 
    '23 Trift Street, 1324', 'November'])
    employee_writer.writerow(['Erica Meyers', 'IT', 
    '45 Yak Rd, Sinclaire, 2345','March'])

with open("employee_file1.csv", mode='w') as employee_file:
    employee_writer = csv.writer(employee_file,

                        # this says always wrap in the quotechar, i.e.
                        # all fields must contain this
                        quoting = csv.QUOTE_ALL)
    employee_writer.writerow(['John Smith', 'Accounting', 
    '23 Trift Street, 1324', 'November'])
    employee_writer.writerow(['Erica Meyers', 'IT', 
    '45 Yak Rd, Sinclaire, 2345','March'])

# escape the , with pipe -> use QUOTE.NONE
# There is also QUOTE.NONNUMERIC which will quote anything besides numbers
with open("employee_file2.csv", mode='w') as employee_file:
    employee_writer = csv.writer(employee_file,
                        delimiter = ",", quotechar='"', 
                        # this says always wrap in the quotechar, i.e.
                        # all fields must contain this
                        quoting = csv.QUOTE_NONE,
                        escapechar="|")
    employee_writer.writerow(['John Smith', 'Accounting', 
    '23 Trift Street, 1324', 'November'])
    employee_writer.writerow(['Erica Meyers', 'IT', 
    '45 Yak Rd, Sinclaire, 2345','March'])

# Write using a dictionary
with open("employee_dict1.csv", mode='w') as employee_file:
    fieldnames = ['name', 'dept', 'address', 'birth month']
    employee_writer = csv.DictWriter(employee_file,
                        fieldnames=fieldnames)
    employee_writer.writeheader()
    employee_writer.writerow({'name':'John Smith', 
                              'dept':'Accounting', 
                              'address': '23 Trift Street, 1324',
                              'birth month': 'November'})

                              'address':'45 Yak Rd, Sinclaire, 2345',
                              'birth month': 'March'})
   
       
# Write using a dictionary
with open("employee_dict.csv", mode='w') as employee_file:
    fieldnames = ['name', 'dept', 'address', 'birth month']
    employee_writer = csv.DictWriter(employee_file,
                        fieldnames=fieldnames)
    employee_writer.writeheader()
    employee_writer.writerow({'name':'John Smith', 
                              'dept':'Accounting', 
                              'address': '"23 Trift Street, 1324"',
                              'birth month': 'November'})
    employee_writer.writerow({'name':'Erica Meyers',

                              'birth month': 'March'})
    
```

### Using pandas
#### Read

```{python}
import pandas as pd
hr_data = pd.read_csv("hr_data.csv")
print(hr_data)

hr_data1 = pd.read_csv("hr_data.csv", index_col = 'Name')
print(hr_data1)

hr_data2 = pd.read_csv("hr_data.csv", index_col = 'Name',
                        parse_dates=['Hire Date'])
print(hr_data2)

```

#### Write

```{python}
hr_data2.loc['Cookie Cat'] = ['2016-07-04 00:00:00', 20000.00, 0]
hr_data2
hr_data2.to_csv("hr_data_mod.csv")
```

```{python}

```

```{python}

```
