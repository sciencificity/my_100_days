## Lists

```{python ch1}
numlist = [1,2,3,4,5]
numlist

# reverse a list
numlist.reverse()
numlist

# sort a list
numlist.sort()
numlist

for num in numlist:
    print(str(num))

# Can convert a string into a list
mystring = 'vebash naidoo'
mystring
l = list(mystring)
l
l[4]
# returns the last letter from the list, and removes it from the list
l.pop()

# we can insert it back in
l.insert(len(l), 'o')
l

l[0] = 'k'
l

# del is delete and just deletes the item without returning the item
del l[0]

l.insert(0, 'v')
l

# can pop item at a certain index
l.pop(0)
l

# append adds at the last position
l.append('s')
l
```

Mutability: Object that can be changed (e.g. lists as above)
Immutability: Object that cannot be changed (e.g. tuples)

```{python ch2}

l = list(mystring)
t = tuple(mystring)

l[0] = 't'

# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
# t[0] = 't'

# We can talk to a tuple i.e. we can read it, but we cannot edit it
t[0]

```

## Dictionaries
Unordered.

```{python ch3}

pybites = {'julian': 30, 'bob': 33, 'mike': 33}
pybites

people = {}
# Adding to an empty dictionary
people['julian'] = 30
people['bob'] = 103
people

# To interact with a dictionary
pybites.keys()
pybites.values()
# To see each pair of items
pybites.items()

for keys in pybites.keys():
    print(keys)
    
for key, value in pybites.items():
    print(f'{key}: {value}')

```

## Truthiness
False is a boolean value and is false, but there are other data types which are also seen as False - e.g. 0 and 0.0.

```{python ch4}

# Let's try the `is` function - notice it is not correct as 0 and 0.0 are False
# This points to us using == rather as below!
print(False is False)
print([] is False)
print({} is False)
print("" is False)
print(0 is False)
print(0.0 is False)
print(None is False)

print(False == False)
print([] == False)
print({} == False)
print("" == False)
print(0 == False)
print(0.0 == False)
print(None == False)

```

## Lambdas

```{python ch5}
# This function is written to be reused depending on what is significant for you
# E.g. maybe you want to find all even numbers in a list or all odd numbers or all prime numbers
def find_sig_nums(nums, predicate):
    for n in nums:
        if predicate(n):
            yield n

# Here we have a list of the first few fibonacci numbers            
numbers = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]  

# Maybe we want all the odd fibonacci numbers
sig = find_sig_nums(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 1)
for val in sig:
    print(val)


# Maybe we want all the even fibonacci numbers
sig1 = find_sig_nums(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
for val in sig1:
    print(val)

```
