1. Go to Find in Find Menu. <br>
2. Ensure you choose the `.*` for **Regular Expression** find.<br>
<img src = reg1.png><br>
3. Ensure you choose the `Aa` for **Case sensitive** find since regular expressions behave in this manner.<br>
<img src = reg2.png><br>


#### Patterns

1. There are some characters (the MetaCharacters) which need to be escaped before that may be matched. For example here we want to find the literal `.` so we need to escape the `.` by using the backslash character ->> `\.`.<br><br>
<img src = reg3.png><br><br>
<img src = reg4.png><br><br>
2. `\d` i.e. smaller case d, matches any digit<br><br>
<img src = reg5.png><br><br>
3. `\D` i.e. upper case D, matches any non-digit<br><br>
<img src = reg6.png><br><br>
4. This a pattern - the upper case versions negate the search of the equivalent lower case version ones!<br><br>
5. `\s` matches any space, tab or newline character.<br><br>
<img src = reg7.png><br>
6. `\b`, `\B`, `^`, `$`: Are called anchors - they don't match characters but invisible positions before and after characters

    * `\b`: word boundary - if we search for a word boundary with characters *Ha* we see that the first Ha gets matched - it is the start of the new line. Then the space is the word boundary for the next *Ha*. The last *Ha* does not get matched since there is no space between the two Ha's. <br>
    <img src = reg8.png> <br>

7. If we try and find phone numbers in this text we can use `\d\d\d.\d\d\d.\d\d\d\d` where . will match any character but it also matches the number with `*` in it but that is not a valid phone number. To get it to only match the `-` or `.` we have to use our own character set. A character set uses `[]` with the characters we want to match - it basically says match char_a OR char_b OR .... char_x - i.e. it matches single letters. **Note: The `.` does not need to be escaped when in the character set.** <br> <br>
<img src = reg9.png> <br><br>
<img src = reg10.png> <br><br>

    * What if I wanted only 800/900 numbers? I can use the pattern: `[89]00[-.]\d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d\d`. <br><br>
    <img src = reg11.png><br><br>
8. The character set can include the `-` to specify a range. For example `[a-z]` says match any character a, b, c, d ...., z. 
9. The `^` character is a special character as noted above in Pt. 6. Outside of a character set it matches the start of a string, however within a character set it negates the character set specified! So `^s` says give me everything that starts with small letter s. The `[^s]` says match any character that is not small letter s. <br><br>
 
    * Here it says match anything that is NOT a letter. <br><br>
    <img src = reg12.png> <br><br>
    
10. We have quantifiers - the quantifiers come after the pattern we're looking for:

    | *&emsp;&emsp;     - matches 0 or more characters <br>
    | +&emsp;&emsp;     - matches 1 or more characters <br> 
    | {3}&emsp;&emsp;   - matches exactly the number specified within brackets for the character <br>
    | {3,5}&emsp;&emsp; - matches number of characters within the min, max range (e.g. here it says match 3, 4, or 5 chars) <br>
    | ? &emsp;&emsp; - matches 0 or 1 of the character <br>
    
E.g. here `\d{3}[-.]\d{3}[-.]\d{4}` says match 3 digits followed by a `-` or `.`, followed by another 3 digits, followed by another `-` or `.`, followed by 4 digits. <br>

<img src = reg13.png> <br><br>

E.g. here `M(r|s|rs)\.?\s[A-Z]\w*` says match all the Mr, Ms, etc. The `()` creates a group and here we are saying look for anything that starts with **M** followed by either **r, s, or rs**. The `?` after the *\.* says that a `.` is optional.<br> 

<img src = reg14.png> <br><br>

To find the email addresses let's use `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z-]+\.(com|edu|net)`. <br>
<img src = reg15.png><br><br>

Here we added the `.co.za` address. The pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` matches all emails.

<img src = reg16.png> <br>

11. We can group things, and then do cleanup using our groups. In the below we captured 3 groups, as well as an implicit group 0 which is the whole string that was matched. Here we are replacing the text with the text *Group 2: * followed by the captured group 2. Groups can be seperated by pipe characters which means OR - e.g. `( (egg) | (bacon) | (spam) | (and) )+` <br>

Original: <br>
<img src = reg19.png> <br>

Replacement 1: <br>

<img src = reg17.png> <br>

Replacement 2: If we replace our urls with just the domain then we get the following: <br>

<img src = reg18.png> <br>


### Python Regex
**2020-02-04**

1. A raw string in Python is a string prefixed with an r''. It tells Python not to handle backslashes in any particular way and makes your regex pattern more readable. We should try and always pass the re.compile() method a raw string as `r'this is a \d raw string \n'`.

2. Methods:

    * The match() method only looks for if it can find the pattern you're looking for in the beginning of the string, or alternately matches an entire string so if you're looking for 810223 in a string surrounded by other info you would have to precede and succeed the pattern with wildcards like `r'.*\d{6}.*'`. 
    * The search() method on the other hand looks everywhere in the string and returns the first match.
    * The finditer() method returns all matches with additional metadata like where the match is in the string etc.
    * The findall() method returns just the matches as a list. If you have groups in your regex, it will return all groups as tuples within the list. Put brackets `()` around the entire pattern string if you want the full match to be returned too.

3. Match anything (from [Al Sweigart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abrcJ9MpF60) talk) <br>

    - use `.` to say match anything apart from the newline
    - combined with *: `.*` which means match whatever
    - .*? means match the least amount of whatever

#### When not to use a regex
1. If you want to find out if the text starts with some values - just use `startswith()`.
2. If you want to find out if the text ends with some values - just use `endswith()`.
3. Want to check if some string is in the text? Just use `'xxx' in text`.
4. Want to replace xxx with yyy? Just use `text.replace('xxx', 'yyy')`

```{python}
text = 'Awesome, I am doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge'
# Does text start with Awesome ?
text.startswith('Awesome')
# Does text end with challenge ?
text.endswith('challenge')
# Does text contain '100daysofcode'? - case insensitive
'100daysofcode' in text.lower()
# What if I want to replace 100 with 200? Remember strings are immutable, so save to new string
text2 = text.replace('100', '200')
print(text2)
print(f'Original string was: "{text}", new string with replacement is: "{text2}"')
```


```{python}
import re
text = 'Awesome, I am doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge'
print(f"The search method looks if it can find substring anywhere in string: {re.search(r'I am', text)}")

print(f"The match method looks if it can find substring at beginning of string: {re.match(r'I am', text)}")
print(f"The match method looks if it can match beginning to end of string so use wildcards: {re.match(r'.*I am.*', text)}")

hundred = 'Awesome, I am doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge'
two_hundred = 'Awesome, I am doing the #200DaysOfCode challenge'

# capture matching string
# use the capturing parentheses - any regex inside the parentheses that
# matches the string will be stored in a match object which we can access with groups
# For match() we need to account for anything that comes before and after the pattern we
# are looking for
m = re.match(r'(.*#\d+daysofcode.*)', hundred, re.IGNORECASE)
print(m.groups())
print(m.groups()[0]) # to get the match out of the tuple returned

m = re.search(r'(#\d+daysofcode)', hundred, re.IGNORECASE)
print(m.groups())
print(m.groups()[0]) # to get the match out of the tuple returned

all_strs = hundred + two_hundred
m = re.search(r'(#\d+daysofcode)', all_strs, re.IGNORECASE)
print(m.groups())

m = re.findall(r'(#\d+daysofcode)', all_strs, re.IGNORECASE)
print(m)

text = '''
$ python module_index.py | grep ^re
re                  | stdlib  | 005, 007, 009, 015, 021, 022, 068, 080, 081, 086, 095
'''
m = re.findall(r'\d+', text)
print(m)
```

#### Findall

```{python}
text = """Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been 
the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum"""
print(re.findall(r'\w+', text))
# alternate is to use split - does same as above
print(text.split()[:5])

# We want to find the most common words starting with an uppercase character
upper_case = re.findall(r'[A-Z][a-z0-9]+', text)
print(upper_case)

# To get most common words - wrap in a counter
from collections import Counter
cnt = Counter(upper_case)
print(cnt.most_common(3))
```


#### Compiling regexes
If you want to run the same regex multiple times, say in a for loop it is best practice to define the regex one time using re.compile. <br>

You can use `re.VERBOSE` which ignores spaces and comments in the pattern string so you can spread your pattern over several lines to make the pattern regex more readable. 

```{python}
movies = '''1. Citizen Kane (1941)
2. The Godfather (1972)
3. Casablanca (1942)
4. Raging Bull (1980)
5. Singin' in the Rain (1952)
6. Gone with the Wind (1939)
7. Lawrence of Arabia (1962)
8. Schindler's List (1993)
9. Vertigo (1958)
10. The Wizard of Oz (1939)'''.split('\n')
print(movies)

# What if we want to find only movies with 2 words
pattern = re.compile(r'''
                      ^                           # start string (these comments are ignored)
                      \d+                         # one or more digits
                      \.                          # a . after the number 
                      \s                          # a space
                      [A-Za-z']+                  # a word
                      \s                          # a space
                      \w+                         # another word
                      \s                          # a space
                      \(                          # a bracket
                      \d{4}                       # a year
                      \)                          # a closing bracket
                      $                           # end of string
                      ''', re.VERBOSE)
# matches = re.finditer(pattern, movies)
for i in movies:
    print(i, re.search(pattern, i))

```

#### String replacing

```{python}
text = '''Awesome, I am doing #100DaysOfCode, #200DaysOfDjango and of course #365DaysOfPyBites'''
# I can replace the text 200 and 365 using the text.replace() but I will have to chain together
print(text.replace('200', '100').replace('365', '100'))

# re.sub() helps to make a more flexible replacement regex
re.sub(r'\d+', '100', text)
# This works better since if there were more numbers you needed to replace with '100'
# you don't have to create this monster chain ... rather 1 small bit of code does the trick


# What if I wanted all days to be 100 days of Python
re.sub(r'(#\d+DaysOf)\w+', r'\1Python', text)
```

### Bite 2. Regex Fun
Learn Python regular expressions by writing the following 3 functions.

In each function's docstring we show the expected result.

The tests verify these expected results when you hit Save + Verify. We will do a more ample regex bite later on.

Note that for parsing HTML you would use a library of some sort, this is just to train your regex skills.
